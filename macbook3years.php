				<h2> <strong>Vancouver - $1,999</strong></h2>

				Custom built hotrod? Aren't you overselling it a bit there? I mean this pig has 8 GB ram, has 2.5 ghz and you're charging $2000 for it? Oh wait you were hoping no one would notice with the $1999? Nice try! Do you realize how outdated this machine is? What is with apple fan boys trying to get their money back after 3 years of using a machine. If you didn't use it for 3 years, then you made a very poor life decision my friend. Who buys an expensive laptop just to let it sit in a closet somewhere? Anyway, I'll give you $500 for it and that is being really generous given how outdated this machine is. Every day you look at this machine, it is probably a constant reminder of your poor decision to buy it. Anyway, that is my good deed for the day, my offer is only good for a couple of days.<br />

				<p>The offer of $500 is not valid anymore. If you've had lots of hits on this pig, have you sold it yet? lol didn't think so. Especially since you're complaining like you're a bit too small where the sun doesn't shine.<br />

				The ad is still up? Okay okay, I think you've learned your lesson. I'll put that offer of $500 back up. I'm in a charitable mood. But only on one condition. You apologize to me for your harsh words and admit you over priced the laptop.<br />

		    Are you willing to apologize to me and admit you over priced your item? First step towards any sort of recovery is admitting to yourself that you've made a mistake.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>You're welcome.<br />

            <p>I don't have time to meet these days as I focus my time and energy in saving people on craigslist from themselves. Look, you made a bad decision with the laptop, you shouldn't be that tough on yourself, we're human and some of us make silly mistakes. But you need to admit it and I just need you understand this, it is important to me that you come to terms with your mistake. So when you're ready to do that, I'll be willing to listen.<br />

            <p>Well, what can I say, you're very perceptive. A person of many talents indeed. I mean, judging by your ability to buy expensive laptops and let them sit in a closet for 3 years, I have no doubt you're going all the way to the top. I'm not surprised, you probably thought it was like wine, the older the better am I right?</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Perception is a funny thing, we all believe it is our reality that is &quot;the reality&quot;. We need to actively learn to be more self aware. You need to figure out the path you wish to lead and the person you want to become. I can only show you the way, but you need to walk through it. Turn your life around and shape up sir. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Best,<br />
