				<h2> <strong>Los Angeles - $2,000</strong></h2>

				Is that really an authentic Louis Vuitton? Anyway, I've often wondered, is there a biological urge for a female to pay so much for a purse? Certainly isn't driven by survival instincts. Guys do not actually care about it, so it clearly isn't for a ritual mating purpose. Or is it a symbol of your pecking order between the other girls? The more expensive the purse, the higher your social standings within the group right? So what happens when someone shows up with a more expensive purse? Do you then have to sell the old one on craigslist and buy a new one with hubby's money? Perhaps this is just an LA thing? If my memory serves me, I think I saw a similar looking purse on the little mermaids when I was a kid. The sea witch might have had it, but can't remember. $2000 is a lot to pay for something that's only going to get someone on a lower pecking order in your circle of awesome friends. Plus that bag kind of looks like it was created in an arts and crafts class. But hey, on that note, I'd like to give this to my girlfriend as a gag gift. So would you take $50? It is perfect for her circle of friends. They're not as fun as your circle with your housewives of orange county meetups and little mermaid sing alongs. But it would be a funny gift. </p>

				<p>It's NOT a purse but a piece of collectors item luggage. You need psychological help for your rage. Bugger off </p>

				<p>Hey look, I didn't mean anything by it, I was merely curios about your reasons for selling the purse. I tend to wonder about the mental state of people as they make life altering decisions. I guess the problem here is I care too much about people and feel the need to impart wisdom on to them. I hope you can find peace in knowing that people do infact care.<br />

				You're a broke dick and I feel sorry for your gf. Further contact constitutes harassment and I will forward to the police department and my attorney.<br />
