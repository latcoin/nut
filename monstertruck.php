				Hi Brad,</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>I have a group of people that would like to use your truck as a toilet. It looks to be well made for that purpose. They would be willing to pay you $5 - $10 for each use ($5 for peeing and $10 for pooping). As you can see, from a business sense, this is a far greater amount of profit that one could generate from a public toilet. Let me know if you're interested as your truck looks like it was designed to be used as a public toilet. Goes without saying, but just to be clear, you would be cleaning up after.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Thanks!</p>

				Cool, when would you like to meet up? I think this could be a very exciting venture. I've started informing people of your truck and they're lining up! <br />

				How about we meetup somewhere private? Perhaps in an alley somewhere? I'll have the keys ready for you. <br />

            <p>Judging by your name u are obviously from Mexico &amp; didn't have much schooling I could care less what you think about my vehicle u see the price &amp; if u not interested don't look &amp; don't waste my time with your stupid bullshit</p>

				Judging by your poor grammar, I'd have assumed you were the one from a foreign place. Not Mexico though, they can articulate themselves better than that of a 5 year old. If I'd have to guess, I'd say some really broke and uneducated place like Atlanta.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Now listen, I'm a busy person and I don't have time to waste here. I presented you with an offer, you're either interested or you're not. Stop wasting my time please. I have important things to do.</p>
