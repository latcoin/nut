				Hi Brad,</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>I have a group of people that would like to use your truck as a toilet. It looks to be well made for that purpose. They would be willing to pay you $5 - $10 for each use ($5 for peeing and $10 for pooping). As you can see, from a business sense, this is a far greater amount of profit that one could generate from a public toilet. Let me know if you're interested as your truck looks like it was designed to be used as a public toilet. Goes without saying, but just to be clear, you would be cleaning up after.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Thanks!</p>

				Cool, when would you like to meet up? I think this could be a very exciting venture. I've started informing people of your truck and they're lining up! <br />
